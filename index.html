            <p style="line-height: 2;">Hour Of Code - was a second homework , which actually was one of the most difficult tasks. Students were divided into the groups of 3-5 people. The main goal of the
homework was to find the school, prepare the presentation about the basics of programming, and to explain what is programming to the pupils of the school.
Additionally, we presented a presentation about ADA University, where we encouraged pupils showing the quality of education and positive feedback of students about university.
Our team negotiated with school №145 to provide a full lesson, to introduce our two presentations and explain the programming basics using the Code.org website,where
we showed how to write the code by combining interesting information, and practice which actually was just the puzzles. For solution of each puzzle pupils needed to
write a code, that would fit the solution.
The project was very unusual and interesting both for team members and school pupils.

                <p>“How Website Works?” - was our third homework, where our goal was to create a website using HTML,CSS,
and JavaScript. Firstly, we decided to give a certain name to our team. After long discussion we
stopped at “Utopia”.</p>
            </div>
      <div class="quote">
        <p>Secondly, we decided to make beautiful design to our website and logotype following minimalism.So we decided to take a black, white and lavender color in navigation menu. Design of website was created with Figma graphic editor,
which is used for web design.</p>
          </div>
      <div class="quote">
        <p>After designing the website’s each page, we started to write the code on HTML, CSS, and Javasript, adding animations on buttons, and making it more creative and beatiful.
Website consist of several details: Main page with our team name, navigation bar, Hour of Code project, Website
preparation and Team members. In each of these pages we describe the certain topic as Hour of code
project details, personal information about each of the team members, and how was the website
prepared. In general this homework was very interesting for us, and gave more experince in coding
and design.</p>
